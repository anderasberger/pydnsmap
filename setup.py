    pydnsmap processes DNS FQDN-to-IP mappings extracted from DNS traffic and
    reveals FQDNs and IPs which may used for cybercrime activities. It
    builds and maintains an efficient data structure which represents these
    mappings (i.e., the map). It ignores mappings which are sufficiently
    similar to previously seen ones, and outputs those ones which are not. By
    further analyzing those using simple graph analysis, malicious mappings are
    identified.
