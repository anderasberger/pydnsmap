INSTALL
-------

The following python modules are required:
numpy, scipy, netaddr, python-levenshtein

(to be extended?)

Run the protocol buffer compiler to generate the protobuf Python modules from
the schema definition:
protoc --python_out=. ticket_dns.proto

Download the latest AsNum database from http://www.maxmind.com/en/asnum and
put it in the /data directory. An older version should be already there,
overwrite it.

RUNNING
-------
1. Adapt config.py (see inline comments)

2. Run 'python pydnsmap.py'. This should create a subdirectory (as specified in
config.py) where the following files are written: (i) a log file (by default,
it's called pydnsmap.log); (ii) a file called 'suspicious.txt', containing all
suspicious domain-ip mappings that were found; (iii) a file that contains the
final DNSMap in Python's pickle format. this is written just before the tool
terminates, unless this has been deactivated in config.py

3. Run 'python dnsmapGUI.py'. This allows you to load suspicious.txt, filter
the records therein, explore the resulting mapping graph, and export the final
list of malicious domains and IPs to a text file.
